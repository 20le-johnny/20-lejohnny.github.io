        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A band of aliens decide to invade the planet, Earth. A man, Io, decides to 
        take matters on his own hands. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration
        heard about this and offered him a ship. It has taken months of development of 
        the ship. But luckily, the day the aliens have decided to invade, your ship 
        is set. NASA sends out you and now you are on your own. You will decide the 
        fate of humanity and its future generations... 

        The scoring impliment was the amount of points you get by each aliens you destroy. 
        The use of the randomness is by the time when the red alien shoots its lasers. 
        The game gets more difficult depending on the difficulty you have chosen. 
        The harder the difficulty, the slower fire rate your ship will have. This 
        gaves you a disadvantage on how fast you can shoot. 
        The game ends if you destroy all the ships before they reach Earth's surface. 
        You can lose if your ship gets destroyed by the alien's lasers or if they end 
        up reaching Earth's surface. </p>
        
        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        
        <p>We recreated this classic because it was simple, but still enjoyable to all. Some
        successful points in the development in our game was being able to use our own fonts 
        and recreating the exact aliens in "Space Invaders" and putting them into our game
        One of the obstacles we faced was having multiple aliens on the screen, we did not know
        whether to clone or just duplicate the sprites. If we had more time, our game would be 
        much better developed with less bugs and solid gameplay. </p>
        <h2>Algorithm</h2>
        
        <p><img src="script.png" id="algorithm"> </p>
        
         <p>This provided algorithm allowed all the aliens to move at the same pace.
        The algorithm has all the aliens shift to one side and move down then shift 
        to the other end of the side and down. Where the algorithm will repeat its 
        process during the entire game. Without this algorithm, the aliens would have 
        gone out of order which is one of the significance of the game. </p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p> A student is studying for a test late at night. You are to decide which
        actions he should take and where the actions would lead to.</p>
        
        <h2>Flow Chart</h2>

        <h2>Incremental and Iterative</h2>
        <p>When coding our story, we simply reused one code to change the scenes when making a decision. We defined
        the scene, and if chosen in the correct order, the scenes will trigger the next decision. Almost like a loop. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Difficulties</h2>
        <p>The difficulties that my partner and I had encountered was getting the right scenes
        to play out when certain choices were made. It was also difficult if we had an indent error or something like that
        because we would be stunted for almost an hour trying to find it and fix our mistake.
        These issue were resolved by taking extra precautions when typing up the scripts to ensure
        we were doing things correctly.

        <h2>Procedural Abstraction</h2>
        Organizing scenes of your story into functions is a form of procedural
        abstraction because you are putting your scenes to functions that would
        execute from top of bottom. The advantages of abstracting your scenes into
        functions is that your story would execute as expected.
        
        <br>
        <h2>Other Stories</h2>
        One story I liked was "The Heroic Princess?" by Tai and Clemet because the
        story had a lot of depth to it. Almost like an AP LAng student had wrote it. Although
        it was quite long and straining for my brain to process, it had an interesting
        plot and immersed me into the story.
